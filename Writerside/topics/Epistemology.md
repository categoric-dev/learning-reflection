## Qualities of Knowledge

Grouping these qualities by relevant attributes will provide a clearer framework. Here's one way to categorize them:

**I. Foundational Qualities (Essential for Something to be Considered Knowledge):**
1. **Truth:** Accurately reflects reality.
1. **Belief:** Held as true by the knower.
1. **Justification:** Supported by reasons, evidence, or logic.

**II. Epistemic Qualities (Relating to Knowing and Understanding):**
1. **Reliability:** Consistent and dependable across contexts.
1. **Explainability:** Provides coherent explanations and makes predictions.
1. **Contextual Nature:** Dependent on cultural, social, historical factors for interpretation.
1. **Subjectivity:** Influenced by personal perspectives and experiences.

**III.  Process and Scope Qualities (How Knowledge is Acquired and Organized):**
1. **Acquisition:** The process of gaining knowledge.
1. **Scope:** Breadth and depth of a body of knowledge.

**IV. Application and Impact Qualities (Consequences of Having Knowledge):**
1. **Transmissibility:** Ability to be shared and communicated.
1. **Practical Application:** Used to solve problems, make decisions, improve situations.
1. **Ethical Considerations:** Moral implications associated with knowledge use.

**V. Dynamic Qualities (Reflecting the Evolving Nature of Knowledge):**
1. **Accumulative Nature:** Building upon previous knowledge.
1. **Dynamic Nature:** Constantly evolving and refining over time.
1. **Interdisciplinary Connections:** Linking different fields of knowledge.

This grouping helps us see how the various qualities of knowledge connect and contribute to a richer understanding of what it means to "know" something.

**Here are a few alternative approaches, each highlighting different aspects:**

**I. By Focus:**
   1. **Acquisition & Transmission:** Deals with how knowledge is gained and shared (acquisition, transmissibility). 
   1. **Applicability:** Emphasizes the practical uses of knowledge (practical application, ethical considerations). 
   1. **Nature & Structure:** Considers the broader context and organization of knowledge (scope, interdisciplinary connections, accumulative nature, dynamic nature).

**II. By Level of Abstraction:** 
   1. **Concrete:** Directly related to observable actions or outcomes (practical application, transmissibility). 
   1. **Abstract:** Deals with underlying principles and relationships (reliability, explainability, subjectivity, contextual nature).

**III. By Stakeholder Perspective:**
   1. **Individual:** Qualities relevant to a single person's understanding and use of knowledge (belief, justification, acquisition, subjectivity). 
   1. **Collective:** Qualities emphasizing shared knowledge and its impact on society (transmissibility, ethical considerations, interdisciplinary connections, accumulative nature).

The best way to categorize depends on the specific context and what you want to emphasize. There's no single "right" answer!

## Knowledge forms

### Foundational qualities 

Truth, belief, and justification are key to distinguishing different forms of knowledge. Here are some ways we can categorize knowledge based on them:

1. **By Truth:**
   1. **Propositional Knowledge:** This is the most common type, focusing on true propositions or statements. For example, "The Earth revolves around the Sun" is a propositional truth.
   1. **Knowledge by Acquaintance:** This refers to direct, firsthand knowledge of something. Imagine knowing the taste of chocolate or the feeling of sunshine on your skin.
1. **By Belief:**
   1. **Justified True Belief (JTB):** The classical definition of knowledge, requiring all three elements: truth of the belief, holding that belief, and having justification for it.
   1. **Mere Belief:** Holding a belief without sufficient justification. For example, believing you'll win the lottery despite low odds.
1. **By Justification:**
   1. **Empirical Knowledge:** Based on sensory experience and observation (e.g., knowing the color of your shirt).
   1. **Rational Knowledge:** Derived through reasoning and logic (e.g., understanding mathematical theorems).
   1. **Testimonial Knowledge:** Obtained from trustworthy sources, such as experts or eyewitnesses.

**Other Forms:**

* **Procedural Knowledge:** Knowing "how" to do something, like riding a bike or playing an instrument. This often involves tacit knowledge that's difficult to articulate verbally.
* **Implicit Knowledge:** Unconscious knowledge or skills that we may not be aware of but can still demonstrate. Think about knowing how to tie your shoes without consciously thinking through each step.

> It's important to remember that these categories aren't always mutually exclusive. For example, procedural knowledge often involves both empirical (observing the results of actions) and rational (understanding the underlying principles) elements.
> Establishing a strict hierarchy among these forms of knowledge is tricky and often debated by philosophers. 
> Different forms of knowledge emphasize different aspects of truth, belief, and justification, making direct comparison difficult.
> {style="note"}

Here's a possible framework, emphasizing **strength** rather than strict hierarchy:

1. **Justified True Belief (JTB):** Often considered the "gold standard" as it fulfills all three foundational criteria. It represents reliable knowledge with strong grounding.
1. **Empirical & Rational Knowledge:** These forms often lead to JTB when rigorously applied. Strong empirical evidence or sound logical reasoning significantly increase the justification for a belief, making it closer to true knowledge.

1. **Testimonial Knowledge:** Relies heavily on trust in the source. While valuable, its strength depends on the credibility and reliability of the informant. It's weaker than directly acquired knowledge because you haven't personally verified the truth.
1. **Procedural & Implicit Knowledge:** These forms are harder to place. They demonstrate "knowing how" rather than explicit "knowing that." Their truthfulness is often assumed based on successful application, but explicit justification can be challenging to articulate.

1. **Mere Belief:** Lacks sufficient justification and therefore falls outside the realm of reliable knowledge.

**Important Considerations:**

> **Context Matters:** The "strength" of a form of knowledge can vary depending on the context. For example, in a survival situation, practical procedural knowledge (knowing how to build a fire) might be more crucial than theoretical rational knowledge.
> {style="warning"}

> **Subjectivity:** Even JTB can be influenced by individual biases and perspectives, making absolute objectivity difficult to achieve.
> {style="warning"}


> Rather than a rigid hierarchy, it's more helpful to see these forms as existing on a spectrum of epistemic strength, with each form having its own value and limitations depending on the situation.
> {style="warning"}

### Epistemic Qualities

Reliability, explainability, contextual Nature, subjectivity they reveal a lot about how we understand and use knowledge! While it's difficult to rigidly categorize knowledge based solely on these qualities, here are some potential forms that emerge:

1. **Reliable Knowledge:**
   1. **Scientific Knowledge:** Characterized by rigorous testing, replicability, and constant refinement through peer review and further research.
   1. **Historical Knowledge:** Based on primary sources, scholarly analysis, and careful interpretation of evidence. While subject to revision as new information emerges, it strives for accuracy and objectivity.
1. **Explanatory Knowledge:**
   1. **Theoretical Knowledge:** Seeks to understand underlying principles and causal relationships (e.g., physics theories explaining gravity or biological theories describing evolution).
   1. **Narrative Knowledge:** Explains events or phenomena through stories and interpretations. While not always strictly factual, it can provide valuable insights into cultural contexts and human experiences.
1. **Contextual Knowledge:**
   1. **Cultural Knowledge:** Specific to a particular group or society, shaped by shared beliefs, values, and practices (e.g., understanding social norms, rituals, or language).
   1. **Situational Knowledge:** Dependent on the immediate context. Knowing how to behave at a formal dinner differs from knowing how to act in an emergency situation.
1. **Subjective Knowledge:**
   1. **Personal Experiences:** Uniquely yours and shaped by your individual perspective, emotions, and memories. While valuable, it's not necessarily generalizable or objective.
   1. **Aesthetic Judgments:** Based on personal preferences and interpretations (e.g., finding a painting beautiful or a piece of music moving).

**Important Considerations:**

> **Overlap:** Many forms of knowledge blend these qualities. For example, scientific knowledge strives for reliability and explainability but is also contextualized within specific paradigms and subject to ongoing revision.
> {style="warning"}

> **Degrees:** These are not absolute categories but rather represent tendencies along a spectrum. Even seemingly objective knowledge can contain elements of subjectivity depending on the observer and their interpretations.
> {style="warning"}


Ultimately, understanding the epistemic qualities of different forms of knowledge helps us critically evaluate their strengths, limitations, and suitability for particular purposes.

### Acquisition and Scope Qualities

Acquisition and scope unveils another dimension to how we categorize knowledge!

Here are some potential forms that emerge:

1. **By Acquisition:**
   1. **Empirical Knowledge:** Gained through direct sensory experience and observation (e.g., learning about the world by interacting with it).
   1. **Rational Knowledge:** Acquired through reasoning, logic, and deduction (e.g., understanding mathematical concepts or philosophical arguments).
   1. **Intuitive Knowledge:** Seemingly arising "from within" without conscious effort, often associated with gut feelings, creativity, or sudden insights.
   1. **Transmitted Knowledge:** Learned from others through communication, education, or cultural traditions (e.g., acquiring language, historical facts, or practical skills).
1. **By Scope:**
   1. **Specific Knowledge:** Narrowly focused on a particular subject or domain (e.g., knowing the rules of chess, understanding a specific scientific theory).
   1. **General Knowledge:** Broad and encompasses a wide range of topics (e.g., having knowledge about history, geography, science, and culture).
   1. **Tacit Knowledge:** Difficult to articulate explicitly but present in our skills, habits, and unconscious understanding (e.g., knowing how to ride a bike, play an instrument, or recognize patterns).

**Important Considerations:**

> **Intertwined Nature:** Acquisition and scope often influence each other. For example, empirical knowledge gained through direct experience might lead to broader general knowledge over time.
> {style="warning"}

> **Individual Variation:** People acquire and organize knowledge differently based on their learning styles, experiences, and interests.
> {style="warning"}

By considering both acquisition and scope, we gain a richer understanding of the diverse ways humans come to know and understand the world around them.

### Application and Impact Qualities

The crucial aspect of knowledge: its practical relevance and impact on the world! Here are some forms of knowledge categorized by application and impact qualities:

1. **By Transmissibility:**
   1. **Explicit Knowledge:** Easily codified, shared, and transmitted through language, writing, or other symbolic systems (e.g., scientific theories, historical facts, recipes).
   1. **Tacit Knowledge:** Difficult to articulate or transfer directly, often learned through experience and practice (e.g., riding a bike, playing a musical instrument, artistic intuition).
1. **By Practical Application:**
   1. **Applied Knowledge:** Directly used to solve problems, create solutions, or achieve specific goals (e.g., engineering designs, medical treatments, business strategies).
   1. **Theoretical Knowledge:** Primarily focused on understanding fundamental principles and concepts, potentially leading to future practical applications but not immediately actionable (e.g., abstract mathematical theories, philosophical inquiries).
1. **By Ethical Considerations:**
   1. **Knowledge with Moral Implications:** Requires careful consideration of its potential consequences and ethical ramifications (e.g., knowledge about genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, or social manipulation techniques).
   1. **Value-Neutral Knowledge:** Generally considered objective and free from moral judgments, although interpretations and applications can still be influenced by values (e.g., mathematical formulas, astronomical observations).

**Important Considerations:**

> **Dynamic Relationship:** These categories are not mutually exclusive. For example, applied knowledge often builds upon theoretical foundations, and even seemingly "value-neutral" knowledge can raise ethical questions depending on its context and use.
> {style="warning"}

> **Societal Impact:** The transmissibility, practicality, and ethical considerations of knowledge shape its impact on individuals, communities, and the world at large.
> {style="warning"}

By understanding these application and impact qualities, we can critically evaluate the value and responsibility associated with different forms of knowledge.

### Dynamic Qualities

A key aspect of knowledge: its ever-evolving nature! Here are some forms categorized by their dynamic qualities:

1. **By Accumulative Nature:**
   1. **Cumulative Knowledge:** Builds upon previous discoveries and insights, expanding and refining over time (e.g., scientific knowledge, historical records).
   1. **Revolutionary Knowledge:** Introduces paradigm shifts that fundamentally alter existing understanding, sometimes rendering past knowledge obsolete or incomplete (e.g., Copernicus' heliocentric model, Darwin's theory of evolution).
1. **By Dynamic Nature:**
   1. **Static Knowledge:** Considered relatively unchanging and fixed within a specific context (e.g., grammatical rules, mathematical theorems).
   1. **Dynamic Knowledge:** Constantly evolving and adapting to new information, contexts, and perspectives (e.g., social norms, technological advancements, political ideologies).
1. **By Interdisciplinary Connections:**
   1. **Specialized Knowledge:** Focused on a narrow domain and often isolated from other fields (e.g., expertise in ancient Greek literature, knowledge of specific programming languages).
   1. **Interdisciplinary Knowledge:** Integrates concepts and methods from multiple disciplines to address complex problems and generate new insights (e.g., environmental science drawing on biology, chemistry, physics, and social sciences; bioethics combining medicine, philosophy, and law).

**Important Considerations:**

> **Continuum:**  The lines between these categories are often blurry. Knowledge can be both cumulative and revolutionary, static in some aspects while dynamic in others.
> {style="warning"}

> **Context Dependence:** The dynamic nature of knowledge is influenced by the context in which it is applied. What is considered static knowledge in one field might be dynamic in another.
> {style="warning"}

By recognizing the dynamic qualities of knowledge, we embrace its ongoing evolution and potential for growth, fostering a mindset of lifelong learning and critical inquiry.

## Theories of Knowledge

Epistemic Knowledge
: Involves understanding what we know, how we know it, and the limits of our knowledge.

> Epistemic Knowledge enhances understanding and validation processes.
> {style="note"}

`Epistemic Knowledge` relates to the theory of knowledge itself, including beliefs about what is true and justified ways to acquire and use knowledge. The pair for epistemic knowledge is `Meta-Knowledge` – both involve higher-order thinking about knowledge, understanding, and belief systems. `Epistemic Knowledge` is more of a domain or perspective within knowledge theory rather than an attribute of specific types of knowledge. Qualities of theory are intrinsic, extrinsic, and dynamic.

**Intrinsic Qualities of Knowledge Theory:**
