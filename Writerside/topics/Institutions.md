# Institutions

Both Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs) and Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs) are entities involved in creating and promoting standards, but they have distinct roles and functions.

## Standards Developing Organization (SDO)

1. **Purpose:** Primarily focused on the development of standards.
1. **Process:** Often involve a formalized process with committees, working groups, and public reviews.
1. **Example:** International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

## Standards Setting Organization (SSO):

1. **Purpose:** Broadly focused on the setting, coordination, and promotion of standards.
1. **Process:** May include activities beyond just development, such as coordination with other organizations, facilitating adoption, and ensuring compliance.
1. **Example:** Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

In essence, while all SSOs are involved in standards development, not all SDOs encompass the broader scope of activities that SSOs do. Both play critical roles in ensuring the interoperability, quality, and efficiency of products and services across various industries.
