# Social Science

**Sociology**
: Is the study of society through systematic investigation and critical analysis, with the goal of understanding and explaining human social activity from individual interactions to broader social structures and systems.

In the `Structuralist` approach of `sociology`, `functionalism` is a significant principle used in several study areas. One area of focus is on the theoretical constructs `institution` and `organization`. I am particularly interested in Functionalism's perspective, which sees society as an intricate system consisting of two central concepts: institution and organization.

**Structuralism**
: is a methodological approach that focuses on uncovering the underlying structures and patterns that shape and influence various aspects of human culture. It emphasizes the interrelationships between elements and their place within a broader system, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of cultural phenomena. It works to uncover the structural patterns that underlie all the things that humans do, think, perceive, and feel.

**Structural functionalism**
: is an approach in sociology that focuses on understanding how different parts of society work together to maintain solidarity and stability. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of social structures and processes and their contributions to the overall functioning of the social system. Functionalism addresses society as a whole in terms of the function of its constituent elements; namely norms, customs, traditions, and institutions.

Institutions
: Are typically well-established entities with broad societal impact, focusing on roles such as regulation, standard-setting, research, and advocacy. They often have flexible structures and can be funded through public support, membership fees, grants, or endowments.

Organizations
: Are structured groups focused on achieving specific goals through product development, service delivery, and operational efficiency. They can be for-profit or non-profit, with hierarchical structures and leadership typically appointed based on their business models.
